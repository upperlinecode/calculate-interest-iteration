# 1. Write a function to calculate the balance of a zero-interest account in which you deposit $230 each year.
# What is the balance after 5 years? After 20 years?



# 2. Write a function that will help you compute how much money you would have after 1 year if you invest a given amount in an account with a particular annual return.
# Then call the function with two different initial amounts to ensure that it works properly.



# 3. Update the invest() function to leverage the time parameter in order to calculate the value of an investment growing at a particular annual rate for 10 or more years.
# Then call the function with different amounts and different times.



# 4. Use your invest() function to compute the value of:
    # i. A $5,000 investment at 3% for 10 years.
    # ii. A $10,000 investment at 3% for 5 years. (double the amount, half the time)
    # iii. A $2,500 investment at 3% for 20 years. (half the amount, double the time)



# 5. Use your invest() function to compute the value of:
    # i. A $4,000 investment at 5% for 30 years.
    # ii. A $4,000 investment at 7.5% for 30 years.
    # iii. A $4,000 investment at 10% for 30 years.



# 6. Who has more money (Clara, Jerome, Z) in their account at age 45? At age 50? At age 65?



# 7. Create three new functions: stock(), indexFund(), and bond(). Each function should take two inputs, initial investment and time of the investment.



# 8. Create a new method called monthly() that takes three parameters: an initial investment, an annual interest rate, and a length of time in years.



# 9. Compare the three payment strategies (Sage, Steve, Sid) to determine how much each graduate will end up paying to the loan company.



# 10. Assume your credit card has an annual interest rate of 12%. Calculate the actual cost of a $1,200 mattress if you pay:
    # i. $50 per month
    # ii. $100 per month
    # iii. $200 per month



# 11. Consider the following two debts:
    # a. You owe a credit card company $2,000 and they charge a 22% annual interest rate.
    # b. You owe a student loan company $20,000 and they charge a 6% annual interest rate.
# If you have $400 per month to pay down debts, which debt should you pay down first? How much would you save by paying that debt first instead of the other debt?
